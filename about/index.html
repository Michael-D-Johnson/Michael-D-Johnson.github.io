<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>
Data for this visualization was taken from the American Housing Survey: <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html">https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html</a>. This dataset includes a wide range of national housing affordability metrics starting from 1985 to 2013 covering odd years. The dataset includes information about cost of housing, burden of housing (housing cost/income), owning versus renting, and subsidized housing.<br></br>

Conclusions are drawn from the two charts presented in visualization: “Average Housing Costs: Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized” and "Average Household Salaries: Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized."

Most recently, for those on subsidized housing, household salaries dropped while housing costs remained constant. The fact that housing costs remained relatively constant for those on subsidized housing is expected, since subsidies are meant to control housing costs. What is interesting is that, since the recession, household salaries for those on subsidized housing have decreased and not improved. Conversely, for those not on subsidized housing, household salaries and household costs have increased at a similar rate, suggesting a smaller impact on housing affordability compared with those on subsidized housing. This demonstrates that a greater burden of housing costs lies with those on subsidized housing. <br></br>

<h1>The Visualization </h1>
<p>
Code for this visualization can be found <a href="https://github.com/Michael-D-Johnson/Michael-D-Johnson.github.io">here</a>.<br></br>

The visualization is an interactive slideshow. There are two data slides and one overview slide. On each slide (except the overview slide), the user can choose to interact and filter the data in a couple of ways. As the user progresses through the slideshow, narrative text is included to give overall context and move the user through the slideshow. The explanation of the data is summarized in the overview slide for those who want to bypass the narrative structure.<br></br>

The progression through the slideshow is aided by text summaries below each chart in order to narrate important points along the way. This progression is facilited by "Next" and "Back" buttons in the upper right corner of each scene. Each scene is anchored by a chart, which is similar in size, scale, and aesthetic to the previous scene, ensuring storyline continuity. Similarly, the positions of the dropdown menu and the navigation bars in each scene are consistently located to help aid continuity between scenes. Lastly, the text below each chart provides the context for each scene and directs the viewer to the next scene.<br></br>

Each chart includes three annotations that describe interesting data points. These points provide additional information that are correlated to the dataset, but give broader context for more meaningful analysis of the dataset. Each point corresponds to the start and end of the housing bubble which resulted in the 2008 recession. These points are put into context in the description below each chart. The annotations are transitioned into the scene in a sequence according to their Year (chronologically). This is done to aid the feeling of journeying through the narrative.<br></br>

While on each scene the user can filter the data displayed by selecting parameters from a dropdown menu in the top left of the scene. The user can select from three parameters: All Data, Before 1997, and After 1997. When a parameter is selected, the chart changes to plot data only within the specified range. In essence, each parameter serves as a "zoom-in" of the data, giving the user a different view of certain time spans.<br></br>

Furthermore, the user can interact with each data point (using d3 triggers). By hovering over a given data point, the user can get an easy-to-read printout of the data values. The data points also increase in size to accentuate the interaction.
