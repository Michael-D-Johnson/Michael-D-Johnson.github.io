<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>
Data for this visualization was taken from the American Housing Survey: <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html">https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html</a>. This dataset includes a wide range of national housing affordability metrics starting from 1985 to 2013 covering odd years. The dataset includes information about cost of housing, burden of housing (housing cost/income), owning versus renting, and subsidized housing.<br></br>

Conclusions are drawn from the two charts within this interactive slideshow: “Average Housing Costs: Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized” and "Average Household Salaries: Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized."

For those on subsidized housing, household salaries dropped while housing costs remained constant. The fact that housing costs remained relatively constant for those on subsidized housing is expected, since subsidies are meant to control housing costs. What is interesting is that, since the recession, household salaries for those on subsidized housing have decreased and not improved. Conversely, for those not on subsidized housing, household salaries and household costs have increased at a similar rate, suggesting a smaller impact on housing affordability compared with those on subsidized housing. This demonstrates that a greater burden of housing costs lies with those on subsidized housing. <br></br>

What is most interesting is that salaries for those on subsidized housing were decreasing well before the 2008 recession. We are seeing the preconditions for the recession. That is, as my first assignment listed above showed, housing values were skyrocketing in the years prior to the recession. At the same time, as seen in this dashboard, household salaries were decreasing over the same period. This is consistent with the narrative that mortgage companies were selling homes in a market that was increasingly having difficulty affording such homes.

<h1>The Visualization </h1>
<p>
The visualization is an interactive slideshow. There are two data slides and one overview slide. On each slide (except the overview slide), the user can choose to interact and filter the data in a couple of ways. As the user progresses through the slideshow narrative text is included to give overall context and move the user through the slideshow. The explanation of the data is summarized in the overview slide for those who want to bypass the narrative structure.<br></br>

The text and progression through the slideshow (the "Next" button), provide the basis for each "scene." Each scene is anchored by a chart, which is similar in size, scale, and aesthetic to the previous slide ensuring continuity. Similarly, the dropdown menu and navigation bars are also similarly located to help aid continuity between scenes.<br></br>

Each chart includes annotations that describe interesting data points. These points are also put into context in the description below each chart. The annotations are transitioned in a sequence chronologically. This is done to aid the feeling of a journey through the slides.<br></br>

<li>Criteria: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the parameters of the narrative visualization, including describing which parameters control the current state of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the parameters of the narrative visualization adequately enough to determine appropriate use.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the parameters of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>2. There are errors in the narrative visualization due to the incorrect use of parameters.	</li>
<li>1. The narrative visualization is incomplete due to incomplete use of parameters.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no parameters.</li>
<br></br>

<li>Critera: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the triggers, including what user events trigger what parameter value changes, and how the viewer is aware of available user events.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the triggers adequately enough to determine the connection between user events and parameter value changes, or adequately enough to determine how available user events are communicated to the viewer.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the triggers of the narrative visualization, or the available user events are not adequately communicated to the viewer.	</li>
<li>2. The triggers are not properly applied (e.g., a user event does not create the expected result).	</li>
<li>1. One or more triggers is incomplete.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no triggers.</li>
