<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>
Data for this visualization was taken from the American Housing Survey: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html. This dataset includes a wide range of national housing affordability metrics starting from 1985 to 2013 covering odd years. The dataset includes information about cost of housing, burden of housing (housing cost/income), owning versus renting, and subsidized housing.
</br>
In the top chart, “Average Household Salary per Income Bracket: Owners vs. Renters, 2001-2013,” it appears that owners and renters have been affected similarly by the recession (the same trends are seen in owners and renters for each income bracket). It is clear from the plot that owners consistently have higher income than renters. This is expected because owning a home is a big investment that usually demands greater income. Most notably the upper three income brackets show a sharp recovery post-recession compared with the lower brackets, which show more gradual (if any) recovery.

<h1>The Visualization </h1>
<p>
First a description of the data and data source. 
Then a write-up following the rubric below (25pts).
<ul>
<li>Criteria: Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?</li>
<li>5. The narrative visualization correctly follows the hybrid structure stated in the essay.	</li>
<li>4. The narrative visualization follows a different structure than is stated in the essay, or the essay does not state the structure.	</li>
<li>3. The narrative visualization is not properly deployed, and it is difficult to utilize at least one of the key components.	</li>
<li>2. The narrative visualization is not properly deployed, and is missing at least one key component (e.g., the reader-led exploration at the end of a martini glass structure).	</li>
<li>1. The narrative visualization does not follow one of the three hybrid structures.	</li>
<li>0. The submission is not a narrative visualization.</li>
<br></br>

<li>Criteria: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the layout and design of the scenes of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the scenes of the narrative visualization adequately enough to determine appropriate application of layout and structure.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the scenes of the narrative visualization, or the scenes are not all based on the same template.	</li>
<li>2. The scenes are not properly ordered.	</li>
<li>1. One or more scenes is incomplete.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no scenes.</li>
<br></br>

<li>Criteria: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the application of the annotations of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the annotations of the narrative visualization adequately enough to determine when and why they are cleared between scenes, how they highlight data, or what template they follow.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the annotations of the narrative visualization, or the annotations do not follow the same template.	</li>
<li>2. The annotations are not properly applied.	</li>
<li>1. One or more annotations is incomplete.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no annotations.</li>
<br></br>

<li>Criteria: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the parameters of the narrative visualization, including describing which parameters control the current state of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the parameters of the narrative visualization adequately enough to determine appropriate use.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the parameters of the narrative visualization.	</li>
<li>2. There are errors in the narrative visualization due to the incorrect use of parameters.	</li>
<li>1. The narrative visualization is incomplete due to incomplete use of parameters.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no parameters.</li>
<br></br>

<li>Critera: Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?	</li>
<li>5. The essay properly discusses the triggers, including what user events trigger what parameter value changes, and how the viewer is aware of available user events.	</li>
<li>4. The essay does not discuss the triggers adequately enough to determine the connection between user events and parameter value changes, or adequately enough to determine how available user events are communicated to the viewer.	</li>
<li>3. The essay does not discuss the triggers of the narrative visualization, or the available user events are not adequately communicated to the viewer.	</li>
<li>2. The triggers are not properly applied (e.g., a user event does not create the expected result).	</li>
<li>1. One or more triggers is incomplete.	</li>
<li>0. The submission has no triggers.</li>
<br></br>
